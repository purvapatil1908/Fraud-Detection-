# Fraud Detection – Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on credit card transaction data to understand patterns associated with fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The analysis is conducted using Python without applying any machine learning models.

## Dataset
- Source: Credit Card Transactions Dataset
- Total Records: 280,000+
- Features: PCA-transformed variables, transaction amount, and class label
- Target Column: Class (0 = Non-Fraud, 1 = Fraud)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Analysis Performed
- Dataset structure and quality checks
- Class imbalance analysis
- Transaction amount distribution analysis
- Outlier identification using visual methods
- Correlation analysis between numerical features

## Key Insights
- The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions forming a very small percentage.
- Transaction amounts are right-skewed with significant outliers.
- Fraudulent transactions show higher variability rather than consistently high amounts.
- Correlation analysis helps understand feature relationships but does not imply causation.

## Project Type
Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
No machine learning models are implemented in this project.
